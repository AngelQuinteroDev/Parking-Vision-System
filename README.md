# Parking Vision

Parking Vision is an intelligent parking management system that combines AI-based license plate recognition, session and payment control, and real-time monitoring of vehicle entries and exits.

# Overview
Parking Vision is a modular system made up of two main services:

*  Vision API (Python + FastAPI + YOLO + EasyOCR): Detects vehicle license plates from images using deep learning.

* Parking System Backend (Node.js + Express + MySQL): Manages parking sessions, rates, payments, and access control (entry/exit).

The system is designed to integrate with entry and exit cameras and automatically control barriers or gates based on the vehicleâ€™s payment status.

```
git clone https://github.com/AngelQuinteroDev/Parking-Vision-System
cd parking-vision
```
2. **Vision API (Python)**
```
cd vision-api
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # or .\venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
3. **Backend (Node.js)**

```
cd ../parking-system-backend
npm install
